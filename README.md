Earlier i have done small tasks using powerBI where i have used cleaned data.But now for this task i have used unstructured data which had missing values and outliers.first i had transformed the data before loading into the BI platform.There were many missing values,outliers which were replaced with the mean column values.Also, in the flight_details file the dates were not proper(some were in different data types) so had to change that.The above uploaded files are the transformed files which can be loaded directly and can be used for visualization,reports.
